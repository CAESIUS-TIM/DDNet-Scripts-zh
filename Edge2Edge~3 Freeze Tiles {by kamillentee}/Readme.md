This is usefull to jump from one edge to another through 3 freezes. If you press Ctrl+shift+d you see the your coordinates on the right side of the screen. The decimal place of it is usefull for some tricks.

If you stand on edge and want to jump to the right side with the decimal places of 0.62 or 0.66 or 0.81 you can just press jump and d at the same time and it will be a 100% jump. Reverse is possible too, there you go with the coordinates of 0.34 or 0.31 or 0.16.

Because 0.16 and 0.81 are very near to the freeze you can fail the jump sometimes. To prevent this use this config bind that presses jump and direction key at the same time.

Use bind x exec edgejump.cfg to bind it to a key.
Press x another time to use normal arrow keys again
